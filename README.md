# Apokalypsis

*An implicit personality task based on the predictive coding framework.*


*Apokalypsis* (meaning "revelation" in Greek) aims to be a task in which the participant is confronted to ambiguous stimuli (mostly made of noise). However, some of these stimuli might actually withhold meaningful content (in the form images, patterns, forms, symbols) embedded into noise to various degrees.

We could then observe how well a participant is able to detect a particular category of content (for instance, emotionally salient shapes). Additionally, we can assess the participant's tendency to find meaning in pure-noise, and to assess the nature of this "projected" content. This is likely to be informative about the participant's own internal model(s) of the world.
